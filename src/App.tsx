                companies, startups, to publicly traded internaional companies.
                My full-time roles as a senior software engineer at EPAM Systems
                (NYSE: EPAM) and Expedia Group (NASDAQ: EXPE) provided me with
                valuable experience in large-scale operations and complex
                systems. Currently, I work as an independent
                consultant/contractor.

                I built a cool website for a Sino-French education company
                that's all about mixing fun and tech in learning. Here's what I
                did:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Created a slick one-page website to show off their unique
                  approach to education.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The site has two main themes: family fun and high-tech
                  learning methods. I added a neat background-changing effect
                  that the client really wanted.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Here's the clever part: I set up two different domains (.tech
                  and .fun) for the same site. When you visit the .tech domain,
                  it highlights their techy side of education. Hit up the .fun
                  domain, and it shows off their family-friendly, fun approach.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                So, one website, two domains, two different vibes - all
                showcasing how this company blends fun and tech in education.
                Pretty cool, right?

            <h3>Full Solution</h3>
            <p>
              I created a solid web app for a Hong Kong company that helps
              students ace their exams. Here's what I did:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Built the whole thing from scratch - database, server stuff, and
                the user interface.
              </li>
              <li>
                Design and set up a sophisticated relational database to cover
                their business.
              </li>
              <li>
                Coded the behind-the-scenes logic to make everything run
                smoothly.
              </li>
              <li>
                Implemented a user-friendly interface that students actually
                enjoy using.
              </li>
              <li>
                Hooked it up with WeChat (it's huge in China) so users can log
                in and pay easily.
              </li>
              <li>
                Bonus: I helped them grab publicly available data from the web
                to beef up their content.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The project spans the entire tech stack: database management,
              server-side logic, and frontend user interface development.
